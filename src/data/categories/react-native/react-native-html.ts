  title: `Does React Native use HTML`,
  answer: `No — React Native does not use HTML. Instead of <div>, <span>, or <p>, it provides its own set of native components like <View>, <Text>, and <Image>. These map directly to the corresponding native UI elements on iOS and Android, which is why React Native apps feel truly native.`,
