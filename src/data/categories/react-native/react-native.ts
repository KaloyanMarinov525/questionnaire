  title: `What is React Native`,
  answer: `React Native is a framework built by Meta that allows developers to build mobile apps for iOS and Android using React and JavaScript/TypeScript. It uses native components under the hood (via a bridge or the new Fabric/JSI architecture), so apps feel truly native while sharing most of the codebase across platforms.

Key benefits:
- Cross-platform: one codebase for iOS and Android.
- Native performance: uses real native UI components.
- Developer experience: fast refresh, large ecosystem, reuse of React skills.`,
