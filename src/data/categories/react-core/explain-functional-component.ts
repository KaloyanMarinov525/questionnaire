  title: `Explain functional component`,
  answer: `A functional component is a plain JavaScript function that returns React elements (JSX). It can accept props as arguments and use hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) to manage state and side effects. Functional components are the modern standard, simpler and more performant than class components.`,
