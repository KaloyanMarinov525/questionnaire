  title: `What are design patterns and can you name some of them`,
  answer: `Design patterns are proven, reusable solutions to common software design problems. They are not code snippets, but templates for solving issues in a consistent and maintainable way.

Examples of design patterns:
- Singleton: ensures only one instance of a class exists.
- Factory: creates objects without exposing the creation logic.
- Observer (Pub/Sub): notifies multiple subscribers when a subject changes.
- Strategy: defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable.
- Decorator: adds behavior to objects dynamically without changing their code.`,
